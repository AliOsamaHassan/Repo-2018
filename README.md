# Python Codes in Data Science including Tensorflow

Codes in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence

<b> Welcome to my GitHub repo. </b>

I am a Data Scientist and I code in Python. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence models I developed.

<b> Outputs of the models can be seen at my portfolio: </b> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0RLknmL54khdjRQWVBKeTVxSHM/view?usp=sharing
